---browser router



*browser router is parent component and made by react-router-dom 
itself and manages routing from there
*browser router followed by <Routes> component 
*BrowserRouter and Routes comes first time only while Route component can be multiple 

*inside Route component path prop is given with value of path you want to define
*path prop is followed by element prop in which you define component to be shown on that path

*/home will take you to home page as Home component is linked  here


---If you make another componnet and nested it with another compoent you can do it within Route component inside index.jsx(router folder) 


--routing from clicking

*we want to make the menu of the antdesign to navigate with our click
*in this situation always look for end points of api in our case antdesign api

*menu inside layout has endpoint onClick which is a call back function it will return the data related to click like key layout etc



* usually reatc router has link component for routing 
*but for dynamic routing another hook is required which is 
useNavigate
*useNavigate returns a function
*the function requies the path to which to take from current position 
*we get the path from data.key (data is object we get from onClick endpoint given by antd)

--Link componnet


*link ancher(a tag) in html and window.loction in javascript there are two ways to link the component
*Link is another component given by react-router dom 
*<Link> is use for static linking pages
*here we remove our menu and replace it with our own designed one 
and use Link to link them to relevant pages
*Link component get 'to'  props which requires path name as its value


---wrong path

*there is a possiblity that user might enter a wrong path 
*to handle this we add another Route component and pass stric (*) as the path value and in elelment we define what to show if wrong path is given
*we have added NotFound component in element to show it when user enter a wrong path

you can link the back to home button with Link component as well
